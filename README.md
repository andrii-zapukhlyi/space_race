# Winning space race with Data Science
## Applied Data Science Capstone project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

```
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 
Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
```

### In this project, I will predict whether the first stage of the Falcon 9 will land successfully. 
### To do this, I will collect data, clean it, and conduct exploratory data analysis using SQL and Python graphing libraries. In addition, I will create an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash. 
### Finally, I will create 4 machine learning classification algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, SVM and KNN, and choose the one with the highest accuracy.
